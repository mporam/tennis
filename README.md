# Tennis Tournament

Exercise:

Create 8 tennis players
each player needs a name
each player needs a performance rating (a number out of 10) for how well they perform on each court surface (Lawn, Clay & Hard)
each player needs a performance rating (a number out of 10) for how well they perform with each weather condition (Rain, Dry, Snow, Sunny)
When playing against another tennis player the winner decided by multiplying the performance rating for the surface the match is played upon by the performance rating for weather. The highest value wins the match. In the event of a draw replay the match with newly randomised weather & court.
Create a tournament (randomly pair off the players in matches until the final winner is declared) and for each match randomise the court to be played on and the weather conditions.
